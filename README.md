A complete course buying portal created in Next.js with TypeScript safety, using Tailwind for designing, using ShadCN for components, using Lucide Icons for icons, using Convex as a backend, Clerk for user management, and Stripe for payments.

Webhooks are implemented to add data to backend from clerk as well as from Stripe for payments and for subscriptions.

Rate limiting is also implemented using Upstash Redis in order to prevent too many calls to stripe.

Auto-generated emails are also being sent from the platform on user creation, successful course purchase and successful subscription of pro packages.

Screens are as follows:
